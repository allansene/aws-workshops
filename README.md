# AWS Hands-on Labs

Hello and welcome to the AWS Hands-on labs. Before start there are some steps to run:

## Set-up an AWS Account

https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/

## Let"s install the AWS CLI 

* For Mac and Linux users:

    Requires [Python](http://www.python.org/download/) 2.6.5 or higher. Install using 
    [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/).
    
    ```
    pip install awscli
    ```

* For Windows users:
    
    Download and run the [64-bit](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI64.msi) or 
    [32-bit](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI32.msi) Windows installer

## Install Git

Sometimes will be easier if you just clone this repo, instead of copying the files. 
Having the git installed is not a mandatory requisite, but it may help you.

Download and install here: https://git-scm.com/downloads You can have more information 
about git here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started
  
## If you are using a Windows machine...

We strongly recommend you to spin up a Linux EC2 instance. None of these labs were even
tested in Windows environments.

## Now let's get our [hands dirty](./labs)
