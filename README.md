# AWS Hands-on Labs

Hello and welcome to the AWS Hands-on labs. Before start there are some steps to run:

1. Let's install the AWS CLI 

      * For Mac and Linux users:
      
        Requires [Python](http://www.python.org/download/) 2.6.5 or higher. Install using 
        [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/).

      * For Windows users:
      
        Download and run the [64-bit](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI64.msi) or 
        [32-bit](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI32.msi) Windows installer
        
      For more information https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
      
1. Install Git

    Sometimes will be easier if you just clone this repo, instead of copying the files. 
    Having the git installed is not a mandatory requisite, but it may help you.

    Download and install here: https://git-scm.com/downloads You can have more information 
    about git here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started
      
1. If you are using a Windows machine...

We strongly recommend you to spin up a Linux EC2 instance. None of these labs were even 
tested in Windows environments.
